        <h2>ABOUT GAME</h2>
        <p> In a night full of star showers, Sia is out on an adventure to explore the beguiling world of Quantum Computers. But, an evil demon Raka, with his Super-Quantum Gun wants to rule the planet by not letting anyone in this world know about powerful Quantum Technology. Raka is trying to kill Siya with qubit balls shot by his powerful quantum gun. She has to defeat the enemy's qubit balls with her gun. But her gun is not so advanced.  Help Siya in her journey to upgrade her weapons and defeat the demon.     
           <br><br>
        Siya Oh, I completely forgot to tell you the controls. Raka has altered my configurations as well.  â€˜Xâ€™ command will change the colour of the ball. â€˜Hâ€™ command will bring the ball into superposition. Once we complete the level, Siya will also get access to more quantum gates to change ball colour. 
        <br><br>
        You can help Siya unlock her qubit shots by writing 1 line of qiskit code of creating bit.
        You can also use the same process to unlock quantum gates. As Siya progresses through the game, she will be awarded coins ( 50 for level 1, 75 for level 2 and so on ).
        Donâ€™t forget to upgrade her weapons through these coins. Your personal AI is always here to assist you. Good Luck Chief!!
             <br><br>
        Resources: The images of game floors are pre-built and are published by Chris. The AI voice is implemented through Alan AI. The game is built using HTML5 Canvas, CSS and Javascript. We learnt Quantum Computing from Qiskit Textbook, Xanadu Codebook and QBraid Video Course for beginners in the field. The game storyline is made by utilizing suggestions from various industry experts, students and target audiences.   
            <br><br>
        Challenges faced: Each project comes with its own complications and challenges. Our team also had to face difficulties in our path. One of our major challenges was to collect helpful reviews for our project from all sources. We had to circulate our survey form on every forum that we could find. In the making of this project, we often had to come across such software which we had never used before. So learning new software and working on it for our project was a challenge as well.

        <h2>Pre-Build Review</h2>
        <li> Try to make user interface of application easy so that students play game without hustle. Give points for different levels so that those interested already get a fair chance. If possible in future integrate other concepts also of Science.

            As a whole All the best for future. âœ¨ðŸ”¥</li><br><br>
        <li> Well done Bois keep it up!!  </li><br><br>
        <li> School students after seeing your game:"Replace our history books with quantum games!</li><br><br>
        <li> Make it happen my friends. Good wishes and Good luck to you.</li><br><br>
        <li> Quantum Computing can help us to form more complex games as we can play b/w 0 and 1,while our classical computer can 0 and 1. So ,we can make such interesting game in which user have most less probability to win that game.</li><br><br>
        <li> The game needs to have levels and be fun with proper scaling and only slight increase in complexity with each level.</li>
